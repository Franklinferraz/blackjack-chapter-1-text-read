-If you save my son. I'll pay any price, I'll build you brand-new hospital,
-What, there's no part of him that's intact?

[doctor]-His skull's cracked, his neck's broken his lungs're collapsed, his stomach's smashed, his guts are twisted up, and poop is sticking out.

[Mr. Nikula]-You quack!
-The gall... I'll have you hanged! Or sent to the electric chair!

[doctor]-It'll be a miracle if he lasts three days.

[Mr. Nikula]-No limit as to fees!
-Men! Scour the world for a doctor who can cure him!

[Assistent's Mr. Nikula]-A doctor from Japan-a surgical genius. He's cured 300 patients. 
-Chairman! I found a surgeon who can save him for sure!

[Mr. Nikula]-What's this doctor's name?

[Director from the hospital by the phone]-But they can't guarantee success... 

[Mr. Nikula]-If they can't, I don't want them!

[Page 12]
-ROAR

[Assistent's Mr. Nikula]-I don't know his real name, but they call him Black Jack.

[Mr. Nikula]-Black Jack?

[Page 13]
[Mr. Nikula]-You're Black Jack?

[Mr. Nikula thinking]-What a creepy character. Can I really trust him?

[Black Jack]-Where's the patient?
-Hmm...

[Mr. Nikula]-Well doctor?

[Black Jack]-I could do it, but I need another body. Parts beyond remedy will have to be replaced.

[Mr. Nikula]-You mean...?

[Black Jack]-To save this patient, another human has to sacrifice his body!

Taylor Davy

-SKREE

[Person inside the store Taylor Davy]-Welcome...?

[Detective]-You're Davy, the Tailor?

[Davy]-Yes, that's me.

[Detective]-You were at the scene of Mr. Nikula's son's auto accident, weren't you?

-Blow

[Detective]-That crash was your fault!
-You obstructed the vehicle and caused the accident!

[Page 15]
[Davy]-What?!
-The car sped by and crashed all on its own!
-Ridiculous... I was there and saw it, that's all!

-Blow

[Detective]-Are you sure?
-Don't think we don't know that you hated Mr. Nikula's son.

-SPIT

[Davy]-Why nobody likes acudo!
-He's a regular hoodlum. Everyone was just too scared to say so!

[angry detective]--SHUDDAP! You under arrest for attempted murder!

[Davy]-But I've done nothing wrong! Uh!

-KCHINK!

[Assistant's detective]-Come

[Davy]-Mama, don't worry.

[Mother's Davy]-They'll have to prove me innocent. I'll be back soon.

[Detective by the phone]-We arrested the Taylor as you requested.

[Mr. Nikula]-Have him convicted by the end of the day.
-Get te trial going. Buy off the judge and witnesses hear me?
-Anyway, kill him legal means...

[page 17]
[Testimony of person in court]-Just now a witness for the defense has taken the stand.
-Davy is a good son and a proper boy. 
-He'd never do such a terrible thing. 
-And it's true that Acudo, who got into the accident, was a thug.

[Mr. Nikula]-Shut that witness up.

[Nikula's assistant]-Yes, sir.

[Mr. Nikula]-I'm well aware that my son was a troublemaker.

[page 18]
[Mr. Nikula]-But that's not the issue!
-He's my only son. I just want to save my son.
-That kid Davy-could you use his body for my son's operation?

{Black Jack]-I could...

[Mr. Nikula]-Bon't glare at me.

[Black Jack]-Mr. Nikula, do you really want that boy sacrified? For your own good-for-nothing son?

[Mr. Nikula]-A good boy is sacrified fpr a good-for-nothing son... such things happen, too. Ha! The world doesn't exist solely for the righteous!

[Page 19]
[Mr. Nikula]-Money and power! Yes, power!
-Dr. Black Jack, you may be the best surgeon in the world...
-But you practice without a license. 
-You're forced to lurk in the shadows, no?
-HA HA HA... I had you thoroughly investigated.

[Judge]-The court finds Davy guilty and sentences him to death!

[Davy]-What?
-That... that's...

[Davy's Mother]-Davy...

[Davy]-MAMA!!

[Mr. Nikula]-So... the trial is over.
-Doctor, please prepare to operate.

[Davy]-This isn't right. Oh, mama, mama! I won't just roll over and die! I'll be back, I promise!

[Davy's mother]-Lord... have mercy upon him.

[chief of police]-Davy, you will die, but a portion of your body will be provided to Mr. Nikula's son.

[Davy]-Do as you like!!

[page 21]
[Davy]-You serve satan!

[Black Jack]-Have you said your prayers?
-Give me your arm.

-PRICK

[Davy]-Mama...

[Black Jack]-Disinfect him.

[Mr. Nikula]-Finally, Acudo, your operation-you'll be saved!

[Black Jack]-One thing Mr. Nikula. I'll save him, but I won't bear responsibility for anything that happens afterwards.

[Page 22]
[Mr. Nikula]-That's fine! If he's fully healed, I'll have no complaints.

[Black Jack]-All right then. Wait outside.
-I'm doing this alone!

-SHOOP

[Page 23]
[Jack Black]-It's over.

[Mr. Nikula]-And? Is my son...

[Jack Black]-It went well. His bandages can come off in about two months.

[Mr. Nikula]-How about that kid Davy?

[Jack Black]-I used most of his organs and limbs. Hardly looks human now, in bits and pieces. Care to confirm?

[Mr. Nikula]-Ugh... no, that's quite all right.

[Jack Black]-have the money delivered to my hotel.

[Mr. Nikula]-You're not pulling a fast one...
-I will neither run nor hide until he recovers.
-But that's where my resposibility ends. HAHAHA...

[Page 24]
[Narrator]-Two months later...

[Jack Black]-I'm removing the last bandage.

[Mr. Nikula]-ACUDO!

[Jack Black]-Should be all healed.

[Mr. Nikula]-Doctor Black Jack, you really are a master surgeon!

[Jack Black]-My work here is done. So long.

[Mr. Nikula]-Can you tell who I am Acudo?

[Acudo]-Yep

[Page 25]
[Mr. Nikula]-Congratulations, son. As long as you're alive, there's nothing you can't take on.
-Take your time, rest up now.

[Nikula's assistant]-Chairman! The young master is gone!!

[Mr. Nikula]-Gone? How?

[Nikula's assistant]-He snuck out of the hospital and is... missing.

[Mr. Nikula]-Find him right away! Tell the polivec it's their responsibilty!
-That good-for-nothing! As soon as he got better!

[Page 26]
[Davy's mother]-Y... you're...

[Acudo]-Mama, it's me.

[Davy's mother]-Mister Nikula's darling boy...

[Acudo]-It's me, Davy! I'm back mama!

[Davy's mother]-No. You're not my Davy.
-Davy is dead...

[Acudo]-But that wasn't so, mama.

[Page 27]
[Acudo]-Here, if you don't believe me, watch this.
-I'm sure my mama will see.

-SNIP -SNIP -SNIP -SNIP 

[Davy's mother]-...

-SNIP -SNIP -SNIP

[Davy's mother]-That scissor work is... Davy's...

[Acudo fake]-Mama, it was Acudo who died. Dr. Black Jack just operated on my face to make me look exactly like Acudo.
-Said there was no point operating on a rotten body and soul.

[Davy's mother]-D... Davy...

[Acudo fake]-My face is different, but I'm still your son. Is that all right, mama?
-Let's escape to some foreign country, Acudo's dad is looking for me.

[Page 28]
[Davy's mother]-What's all that money?

[Acudo fake]-The doctor gave it to me so we can escape.
-Mama... he must be an angel.

[Narrator]-Black Jack. Apart from being japanese, his background is not known, nor his name. But he is a genius surgeon, and some call his skills divine. Today, too, the enigmatic doctor is performing a miracle with his scalpel somewhere.

[Page 29]
The first storm of spring

[Page 30]
[Black Jack]-Hmph, you're the first one ever to cook up a complaint over an operation I performed.

[Woman]-It's not... cooked up!

[Black Jack]-True eye surgery isn't my specialty,
-But with leucoma it's a cinch.
-Frankly, I believe it went well.
-Why would you see such a thing?
-That's what I don't get.

[Woman]-In the dark... When I shut my eyes...

[Page 31]
[Woman]-I see a tall, handsome man, staring long and hard at me!

[Black Jack]-It's a trick of the imagination.

[Woman]-No it ins't!!

[Black Jack]-All right, all right.

[woman]-You'll get used to it.

[Black Jack]-Give my best to your dad, will you?

[woman]-Oh! I see him, now! He's standing right in front of me!

[Page 32]
[Bar owner]-Doctor, my daughter's thrilled, sayin' she sees better! How'd I ever thank ya?
-At least won'cha let me pay the treatment fee proper-like?
-Askin' instead for free drinks for a month-gotta be kidding me.

[BLack Jack]-Hah... If I billed you real, pops, you'd have a heart attack.

[Bar owner]-Uh, don't scare me...
-See here, drink all ye want.
-Doc, why the sad face?

[Page 33]
[Black Jack]-She said something that's bugging me.

[Bar owner]-Chiaki did? Somethin' rude, doc?

[Black Jack]-Ever since surgery, she sees this man...

[Bar owner]-A man?

[Black Jack]-Yup... some lean young man, every now and then.
-I treated her, so I'm liable. And call it a point of honor.

[Bar owner]-That Chiaki! After ye was kink enough to cure her!
-It's springtime, doc, that's what!
-Lil' missy... been getting starry-eyed of late...
-Must be takin' note of some guy or other.
-It got nuthin' to do with yer surgery!

[Black Jack]-I hope not. But something's nagging me.

[Page 34]
[Chiaki]-Oh!
-I saw him, in that dark doorway!

[colleague Chiaki]-There she goes again with her phantom guy.

[other colleague Chiaki]-Pity... it's cuz we're an all-girls school.

[Chiaki]-He's not a phantom! He was right here!

[shorty colleague Chiaki]-At a pickles warehouse? This morning you saw him in the gym.

[chubby fellow Chiaki]-Chiaki's sure gone boy crazy.

[Page 35]
[Chiaki]-They keep teasing me, but I see him all the time.
-AGAIN!
-Don't run off! Stay there! I'm coming.
-Oops... gone already...
-Is it me, then?
-But why would I picture the exact same face and clothes every time?
-Or is that... Am I really losing it?

[Page 36]
[Black Jack]-It's been two months,
-And you still see him?
-A mental cause...
-If not, some fellow's stalking you. One or the other. It's not an oversight on my part!

[Chiaki]-But I just keep on seeing him...

[Black Jack]-Ever had a boyfriend? Some student?
-Ever been in love?

[Chiaki]-No, doctor. I swear!
-Never mind... I'll be fine...

[Black Jack]-Oh, maybe you will be - but not me!
-What a disgrace, for me-
-for me a to botch a mere cornea transplant!

[Page 37]
[Black Jack]-Cornea
-A cornea transplant!
-Hello, is this the eye bank?
-Yes-the cornea you provided me the other day for a transplant...
-What sort of person was the donor?
-Are you sure?
-I'll be right over.

-KCHAK

[Black Jack]-Chiaki, if you like, I'll drop you off on my way.
-By my name, I'll sort this out.

[Chiaki]-What's an "eye bank"?

[Black Jack]-...

[Page 38]
[Black Jack]-Leucoma, the disease you had.
-Turns a part of your eye called the cornea white and cloudy.
->Vitreous
->Lens
->Cornea
->Retina
-So you replace the clouded cornea with a new one.
-That's what an eye bank is for.
-It's similar to a blood bank.
-But they don't stock whole eyeballs there-
-Only the part known as the cornea.
-It seems this phantom of yours is caused by the replacement cornea.

[Chiaki]-What?!

[Black Jack]-I need to ask them about...
-The donor of  that odd cornea.

[Page 39]
[Chiaki]-When a donor gives it, how does-

[Black Jack]-Usually they're dead.

[Chiaki]-"gasp"
-Again!
-Whoever you are... why do you follow me around? Why do you stare at me so?
-Where are you from?
-Do you exist?
-Or... are you...
-A dream made up by my mind?
-Tell me...

[Page 40]
-Eye Bank
[Black Jack]-Murdered?

[functionary of the eye bank]-Yes. The cornea's donor was a woman called Yoriko Tate, and... "sigh"
-She died 3 months ago. Cause of death: murder.

-National Police Archives
-Archive
[Black Jack]-A murder cade from 3 months ago? Victim's name, Yoriko Tate... Ah, here it is!

[official of the national police archive]-This one's still unsolved.
-The victim was a 19-year-old college student. She was raped, then strangled.

-Mino university human physics dept.

[Black Jack]-Professor Sakyo Komatsu, could the human eye act as a camera?

[Sakyo]-What's this now?

[Black Jack]-I mean, when the visual nerves receive a strong stimulus,
-Could the retina possibly imprint an image onto the cornea?

Note: "Sakyo Komatsu" = Steemed sci-fi novelist best known for japan sinks.

[Page 41]
[Sakyo]-Hmm...

[Black Jack]-For instance the last thing a person saw before dying?

[Sakyo]-hahaha! I didn't know your interests ran that way.
-Maybe in sci-fi, but in real life I'm not so sure.

[Black Jack]-I'm dead serious.

[Sakyo]-Well, spirits and the occult are all the rage.
-Science is full of unknowns, so I don't rule it out.
-Who got killed, by the way?
-Look into that cornea...
-Maybe you'll see the killer!
-No! That's whose face...!

[Page 42]
[Bar owner]-Chiaki? What's wrong?

[Chiaki]-Dad... I can't take it anymore...

[Bar owner]-Can't take what?

[Chiaki]-I think I've fallen in love with him.

[Bar owner]-Who's "him"?

[Chiaki]-The phantom I keep seeing.

[Bar owner]-Don't be funny! Gettin' a crush on some fella that don't exist!

[Chiaki]-But I can't help it!
-I've been seeing him day and night, and I can't stop thinking about him.

[Bar owner]-Chiaki, yer almost a lady now.

[Chiaki]-Dad'll find ye a proper fella-not some phantom hear?

[Bar owner]-That doc who fixed yer eyes, he's young but decent. 
-Perfect for my daughter if ye ask me.

[Chiaki]-...

[Bar owner]-Whatcha drawing missy?

[Page 43]
[Bar owner]-Show me!

[Chiaki]-Nooo!
-That's a picture of him...
-I bet he does exist. I'll find him... no matter what!

[Bar owner]-Don't be talkin' rubbish!

[Black Jack]-Where's your daughter?
-We need to operate again, with a new cornea.

[Bar owner]-Good grief. She's gone and fallen in love with him, of all fellas.

[Black Jack]-Who's that?!

[Bar owner]-She drew it - Her famous phantom lad.

[Black Jack]-Then he's the one!
-I'm taking this with me!

[Chiaki]-I feel like he's close by...

[Page 44]
[Chiaki]-That face! It's him!!
-Ah... I knew it...
-He was real!
-Maybe I'll say hi? 
-But if he's married... If I don't, I might never see him again.

[Man]-Can I help you?
-You've been following me, yes?

[Page 45]
[Man]-There's a bench. Go ahead and tell me your story.
-That's bizarre wow...
-An image of me, a total stranger, imprinted in your eye.

[Chiaki]-This joy... is this "first love"?

[Man]-Hmm. Life sure is full of mysteries.

-SQUEEZE

-THUMP

[Chiaki]-I-I-I... UHM...

[Page 46]
[Man]-You...
-Know, don't you?
-You know everthing-about how I ended Up killing her!
-Can't let you live either, then.
-To think that you came right to me - now, wasn't that lucky.

[Chiaki]-What? What are you saying?
-Whom did you kill?

[Man]-I killed a woman I knew, 3 moths ago! Like this.

[Chiaki]-Uh... ugh...

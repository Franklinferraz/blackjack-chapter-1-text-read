-Dr. Black Jack, you may be the best surgeon in the world...
-But you practice without a license. 
-You're forced to lurk in the shadows, no?

[Davy]-What?
-That... that's...

[Davy's Mother]-Davy...

[Davy]-MAMA!!

[Mr. Nikula]-So... the trial is over.
-Doctor, please prepare to operate.

[Davy]-This isn't right. Oh, mama, mama! I won't just roll over and die! I'll be back, I promise!

[Davy's mother]-Lord... have mercy upon him.

[chief of police]-Davy, you will die, but a portion of your body will be provided to Mr. Nikula's son.

[Davy]-You serve satan!

[Black Jack]-Have you said your prayers?
-Give me your arm.

[Black Jack]-Disinfect him.

[Mr. Nikula]-Finally, Acudo, your operation-you'll be saved!

[Black Jack]-One thing Mr. Nikula. I'll save him, but I won't bear responsibility for anything that happens afterwards.

[Page 22]
[Mr. Nikula]-That's fine! If he's fully healed, I'll have no complaints.

[Black Jack]-All right then. Wait outside.
-I'm doing this alone!

-SHOOP

[Jack Black]-It's over.

[Mr. Nikula]-And? Is my son...

[Jack Black]-It went well. His bandages can come off in about two months.

[Mr. Nikula]-How about that kid Davy?

[Jack Black]-I used most of his organs and limbs. Hardly looks human now, in bits and pieces. Care to confirm?

[Mr. Nikula]-Ugh... no, that's quite all right.

[Jack Black]-have the money delivered to my hotel.

[Mr. Nikula]-You're not pulling a fast one...

[Mr. Nikula]-ACUDO!

[Jack Black]-Should be all healed.

[Mr. Nikula]-Doctor Black Jack, you really are a master surgeon!

[Jack Black]-My work here is done. So long.

[Mr. Nikula]-Can you tell who I am Acudo?

[Acudo]-Yep

[Page 25]
[Mr. Nikula]-Congratulations, son. As long as you're alive, there's nothing you can't take on.
-Take your time, rest up now.

[Nikula's assistant]-Chairman! The young master is gone!!

[Mr. Nikula]-Gone? How?

[Nikula's assistant]-He snuck out of the hospital and is... missing.

[Mr. Nikula]-Find him right away! Tell the polivec it's their responsibilty!
-That good-for-nothing! As soon as he got better!

[Davy's mother]-Mister Nikula's darling boy...

[Acudo]-It's me, Davy! I'm back mama!

[Acudo fake]-Mama, it was Acudo who died. Dr. Black Jack just operated on my face to make me look exactly like Acudo.
-Said there was no point operating on a rotten body and soul.

[Davy's mother]-D... Davy...

[Acudo fake]-My face is different, but I'm still your son. Is that all right, mama?
-Let's escape to some foreign country, Acudo's dad is looking for me.

[Page 28]
[Davy's mother]-What's all that money?

[Acudo fake]-The doctor gave it to me so we can escape.
-Mama... he must be an angel.
